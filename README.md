# Vehicle Maintenance Predictor

## Description

The **Vehicle Maintenance Predictor** is an AI-powered web application designed to predict potential maintenance issues for vehicles based on their model, age, mileage, and symptoms. This tool helps vehicle owners to foresee possible maintenance requirements and plan ahead, reducing the risk of unexpected breakdowns and costly repairs.

The app utilizes an AI model (via the **Google Gemini API**) to process vehicle data and provide predictions regarding potential issues that may arise in the vehicle's future.

## Features

- **Vehicle Model Input**: Enter the make and model of your vehicle.
- **Vehicle Age Input**: Specify the age of the vehicle in years.
- **Mileage Input**: Enter the vehicle's mileage in kilometers.
- **Symptoms Input**: List any symptoms or issues the vehicle is currently experiencing.
- **AI Predictions**: Get predictions about the maintenance required, including specific parts that may need attention.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean and user-friendly interface for easy data entry and display of predictions.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user provides the vehicleâ€™s model, age, mileage, and symptoms.
2. **API Call**: The app sends the collected data to the Google Gemini API, which processes the request.
3. **Prediction**: The AI model returns maintenance predictions, including the possible duration of required repairs and which parts might need attention.
4. **Result Display**: The results are displayed to the user in a formatted way for easy understanding.
